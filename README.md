# Flutter Bus Reservation App with Spring Boot API

This project is a **Flutter** mobile application that integrates with a **Spring Boot** backend API to provide a complete bus reservation system. The backend handles the logic for managing buses, routes, reservations, and more, while the Flutter app serves as the frontend for both **Admin** and **User** functionalities.

## Description

This app allows users to search for available buses, make reservations, and manage their bookings. Admins have additional privileges to manage cities, buses, routes, and schedules. The app is powered by a **Spring Boot** backend that provides RESTful APIs for all operations, including user authentication, bus management, and reservation tracking.

## Key Libraries

Here are the core libraries used in the Flutter project to build the frontend and interact with the Spring Boot API:

### Dependencies:
- **http**: Used to make HTTP requests to the Spring Boot API and interact with backend services.
- **provider**: A state management solution used to manage the app's state across different parts of the application.
- **shared_preferences**: This library is used to store persistent data locally, like user login sessions.
- **freezed_annotation** and **json_annotation**: These libraries are used to generate immutable classes and to handle JSON serialization and deserialization between the app and the API.
- **flutter_easyloading**: A utility for showing loading indicators during long-running operations such as API calls.
- **go_router**: Used for managing navigation and routing within the app.
- **cached_network_image**: Efficiently loads images from the network and caches them locally to optimize performance and reduce bandwidth.
